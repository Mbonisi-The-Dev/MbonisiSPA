# MbonisiSPA

Angular SPA to consume Mbonisi.Integration.Api found on this link >>> https://github.com/mbonisi287/Mbonisi.Integration.Api.

The purpose of the MbonisiSPA is to do the following:

  #Do a search into the Swapi API and Chucknorris and bring back two result sets.
  
  #Get a list of Joke Categories and output the jokes per category.
  
  #Get a list of People from the Swapi API
  
 NB: Important to check which host Mbonisi.Integration.Api is running/pointing to and then change the link on the "ApiService.ts" file on the "endpoint" string variable under the export class of ApiService.
